						<div class="sText">In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. 
						It can also be defined as an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that 
						all of its angles are equal (360/4 = 90). It can also be defined as a parallelogram 
						containing a right angle. A rectangle with four sides of equal length is a square. The 
						term oblong is occasionally used to refer to a non-square rectangle. The word rectangle comes from the Latin rectangulus,
						which is a combination of rectus (right) and angulus (angle).

						<div class="sText">In Euclidean geometry, a rhombus is a simple quadrilateral whose four 
						sides all have the same length. Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, 
						since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus 
						is often called a diamond, after the diamonds suit in playing cards which resembles 
						the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes 
						refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60 degree angle, and the latter sometimes refers 
						specifically to a rhombus with a 45 degree angle. Every rhombus is a parallelogram and a 
						kite. A rhombus with right angles is a square.</div>
